Code for the coursework "Fuzzy Logic Controller for Controlling a Mobile Robot with Obstacle avoidance behaviour"


***Abstract*** This paper describes the design and simulation of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for controlling a mobile robot with obstacle avoidance behavior in indoor environments. The FLC takes three inputs from the readings of nine ultrasonic sensors, and two outputs to generate a voltage value for each of the two wheel motor. The FLC was designed in Fuzzy logic toolbox of MATLAB and simulated in V-REP.
